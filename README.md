# Admin Dashboard

The goals I have for this project are as follows

- Implement reset.css
- Adhere to design spec
    - I am taking the attitude that this is a design handed to my by a client and designed per their desire.
- Implement light / dark mode.
    - Light mode will attempt to adhere to the color scheme in the design spec but dark mode will have some creative liberties for the coloring.
- Utilize all skills learned in this course.
- Utilize CSS Grid as much as possible.
- Ignore mobile responsiveness per Odin recommendation.
- Commit often with robust and clear commit messages.
- Maintain professional approach through entire project.


## Project Review

I reread the assignment and it seemed to encourage us to take some creative liberty.  Specifically, there was no need to copy it pixel for pixel.  I did adhere to the overall layout, but added my own flare!

### Wins for this project
- li elements in the menu are clickable and have unique identifiers.  Important for the future.
- User customizable highlight color selection
- Light/Dark mode themeing
- Transistion animations for several UI elements
- Solid organization of HTML and CSS files with clear separation of concerns
- JS code to insert the project cards, announcement cards and trending cards. This is to simulate pulling the data from an API or database in the future.
- Use of nested grids.
- Scrollable grid containers.
- Commited often and tried to put more thought into the commit messages.

### What I would do different
To be honest, not much.  I feel like there was solid improvement on commits, comments and project organization.  Obviously, these can always be continually improved which is always a goal.  However, for my current skill level and experience I am very satisfied with how this project turned out.
