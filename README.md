# Admin Dashboard

The goals I have for this project are as follows

- Implement reset.css
- Adhere to design spec
    - I am taking the attitude that this is a design handed to my by a client and designed per their desire.
- Implement light / dark mode.
    - Light mode will attempt to adhere to the color scheme in the design spec but dark mode will have some creative liberties for the coloring.
- Utilize all skills learned in this course.
- Utilize CSS Grid as much as possible.
- Ignore mobile responsiveness per Odin recommendation.
- Commit often with robust and clear commit messages.
- Maintain professional approach through entire project.
